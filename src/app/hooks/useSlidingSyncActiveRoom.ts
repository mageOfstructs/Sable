 * Subscribes the currently selected room to the sliding sync "active room"
 * custom subscription (higher timeline limit) for the duration the room is open.
 *
 * Subscriptions are intentionally never removed on navigation — once a room
 * has been opened it continues receiving background updates so that returning
 * to it is instant. Explicit unsubscription (and timeline pruning) only happens
 * when the user actually leaves the room via `unsubscribeFromRoom()`.
 *
 * Safe to call unconditionally — it is a no-op when classic sync is in use
 * (i.e. when there is no SlidingSyncManager for the client).
